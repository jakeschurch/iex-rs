# iex-rs

This is an early work-in-progress wrapper around the [IEX API][1].
It's not yet a crate or anything, I'm working towards getting a
complete mapping of the API before I release anything.

This is also my first Rust project, so pull requests that teach me
neat new things are extremely welcome! :)
